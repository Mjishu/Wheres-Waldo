# Wheres-Waldo

## Description 
This is a wheres waldo clone! It takes the core functionality of the classic game wheres waldo and adds other themes ontop of it.

## Why? 
The core reason was due to [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) curriculum. This project was the first big project that mixed both frontend and backend development. 
I have also wanted to know how so many web games were made and this app let me peek behind the curtain towards the process!
